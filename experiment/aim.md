### Aim of the experiment

To interface an ultrasonic sensor with a Raspberry Pi and write a Python program to obtain distance readings, this experiment demonstrates the use of GPIO pins to measure distances with an HC-SR04 sensor, which calculates object proximity using sound wave echoes, applicable in robotics, parking systems, and level monitoring.
